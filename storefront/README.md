# Shopper Storefront

This directory contains the shopper storefront. The storefront is intended for customers to do their shopping and manage their orders.

## Why NextJS in a different project folder?

NextJS is great for Server Side Rendering (SSR). Setting up this project in NextJS separate from the backoffice allows for separation of concerns. Which means these projects can be built and managed by separate teams, ultimately are de-coupled from one another for future updates.
